# Winter-Project-2019

## December 22, 2019

This is a small project where I will make a checkers AI in java without any major tutorials or guides. This is meant to be used in a resume, to show how I am capable of self-motivation, problem solving, and programming on an intermediate level. I will be documenting my progress on this project as I proceed, including dates, my reasoning for specific ways of coding, and future plans until it is finished in a couple days.

Now for the start of this project, first thing that has to be done is initializing the repository, which includes setting up a java program that can be run and basic file management. I will be using the netbeans IDE, as I am familiar with it and is easy to use. I also chose to use java, even though I am also capable of programming in python and C++, since java is very easy to use when it comes to gui, while it is a nightmare in C++ and I don’t want to learn it in python right now, as the gui is not the main focus of this project.

The next thing, which I hope to finish today, is to initialize the starting checkers board, which I will get to as I finish setting up the repository.
